## Building and Running the Site

To build and run the site locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the Project**: To create a production build of the site, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**: To start the development server and view the site locally, use:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the server, and you can view the site by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

4. **Run the Production Server**: After building the project, you can run the production server with:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

   This will serve the built files, allowing you to test the production version of the site.
